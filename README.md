All required files for demo1 are within the branch "Demo1".

1. Download all four files: Item.java, Player.java, Location.java and Map.java in the same folder. 
2. Compile all four one at a time using: javac
3. Run Location.java.

Playing the game:
When the game is run, the map will print 6x6 grid with a character 'P' representing the player.

The player uses WASD to move left, right, up or down respectively.
For example, the user will press 'w' then enter and the updated map will print.
If the player attempts to move out of the map, the map will print with no movement.
